My interests are focused on computing. I like to study, programme and some other stuffs.

Languages that I have coded before,

↳ **JavaScript**<br>
↳ **HTML/CSS**<br>
↳ **Python**<br>
↳ **C#**<br>
↳ **Java**<br>


most of the time I use studying programation and various things about computers in general.
In my free time I usually play something or watch.
Despite spending a lot of time studying, I appear from time to time in Discord. 
But I keep myself updated every day in my email inbox and alot other places.

Now I'm
  
  - Working on my Skills in Front and Backend develop.
  - Studying Too. LOL, I'm a High School Student.
