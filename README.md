My interests are focused on computing. I like to build, study, programme. Languages I have knowledge,

- **Java**

most of the time I use studying programation and various things about computers in general.
In my free time I usually play something or watch.
Despite spending a lot of time studying, I appear from time to time in Discord. 
But I keep myself updated every day in my email inbox and alot other places.
